1.7.14 2005-08-12
	* Fixed use of uninitialized data by expand_avtab_node by
	  clearing type_val_to_struct in policydb_index_others.

1.7.13 2005-08-11
	* Improved memory use by SELinux by both reducing the avtab 
	  node size and reducing the number of avtab nodes (by not
	  expanding attributes in TE rules when possible).  Added
	  expand_avtab and expand_cond_av_list functions for use by
	  assertion checker, hierarchy checker, compatibility code,
	  and dispol.  Added new inline ebitmap operators and converted
	  existing users of ebitmaps to the new operators for greater

	  Note:  The binary policy format version has been incremented to 
	  version 20 as a result of these changes.
